# macOS setup

1. Install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). iTerm2 is a terminal emulator that is more user-friendly and feature-rich than the built-in Terminal app.
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Homebrew is a macOS package manager that will let you easily install many useful command line tools.
3. Install the Xcode Command Line Tools:
    ```bash title="bash"
    xcode-select --install
    ```
4. [Install Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup/).

    ```bash title="bash"
    brew install jj
    ```

# Windows setup

1. Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. [Install Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup/). Download the prebuilt binary and place it in `/usr/local/bin`.

    ```bash title="bash"
    # https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/releases/tag/v0.31.0
    mkdir -p /tmp/jj-install
    wget -O /tmp/jj-install/jj-linux.tar.gz https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/releases/download/v0.31.0/jj-v0.31.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
    tar -xvf /tmp/jj-install/jj-linux.tar.gz -C /tmp/jj-install
    sudo mv /tmp/jj-install/jj /usr/local/bin
    ```

# General setup

1. Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account if you don't have one already.
2. Create an SSH private/public key pair. This will create two files:

    - a **public** key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, and 
    - a **private** key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`.<br/>

    You don't need to encrypt your **private key** with a passphrase when prompted; just make sure you never share its contents. Your **public key** is the only value that you share to services like Github.

    ```bash title="bash"
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$USER@$HOST"
    ```

3. Add your public SSH key to your Github account: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account. This will let you push (upload) and pull (download) code from Github without your username and password.

4. Install the [Fast Node Manager (`fnm`)](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) by running the following:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
    ```

5. Configure Jujutsu.

    ```bash
    jj config set --user user.name "<Your name>"
    jj config set --user user.email "<Email you use on Github>"
    ```

# Jujutsu basics

[Jujutsu (`jj`)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) is a new(ish) version control system (VCS) that is much more user-friendly and intuitive than Git. Importantly, Jujutsu uses Git as a _storage layer_ which means we can still use Github as our [remote](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) repository.

# Making changes to the blog

1. Request access to the repository (https://github.com/mit-igem/blog) via email or Slack. Provide your Github username in the request.
2. After you are granted access to the repository, clone this blog. This downloads a complete copy of the repository to your computer, where you can make and save edits, and eventually push (upload) those edits to Github, where they'll be compiled and published.

    ```bash
    jj git clone git@github.com:mit-igem/blog.git
    ```
